# Optimization Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of various optimization algorithms and a method for step size selection. 

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Gradient Descent**
- **Gradient Descent with Momentum**
- **AdaDelta**
- **ADAM**

## Step Size Selection

- **Armijo-Goldstein Condition** for choosing the step size
